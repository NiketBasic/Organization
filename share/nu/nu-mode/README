To install add the following lines to your .emacs file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "/some/path")
(require 'nu)

I'd recommend also to install PAREDIT and PARENFACE modes and
activate them for NU-MODE:

(require 'paredit)
(add-hook 'nu-mode-hook (lambda () (paredit-mode +1)) t)

(require 'parenface)
(set-face-foreground 'paren-face "SteelBlue")
(add-hook 'nu-mode-hook (paren-face-add-support nu-font-lock-keywords))


The hook for paredit-mode must be appended, not prepended, to the mode hook
list, as it is usually done by default. This is because the 'heredoc' strings
syntax support is made with help of the syntactic fontification API, and the
mode itself adds a hook to properly fontificate 'heredoc' strings through the
whole buffer when entering nu-mode.

This is still an alpha version, that only has been tested under GNU Emacs 22.1.1.
