INSTALLING NU
=============

These are the instructions for installing Nu on a Macintosh.  See the other files
in this directory for other operating systems.

If you're installed Nu previously using a package manager (e.g. Fink, MacPorts), 
start by using the package manager to uninstall the old version.

BUILD NU
--------

1. Use make to build mininush, a minimal version of the Nu shell.

% make

2. Now use mininush to run nuke to complete the Nu build process.
   This builds Nu.framework and nush, the Nu shell.
 
% ./mininush tools/nuke

INSTALL AND TEST NU
-------------------

3. Use mininush again to install Nu, nush, and the Nu tools.

% ./mininush tools/nuke install

Since the copying step uses "sudo", you will be prompted for your password.

4. Test your installation.

% nuke test

From now on, you can use the installed nush to run nuke. To see for
yourself, rebuild everything from scratch:

% nuke clobber
% nuke
% nuke install

See the Nukefile for other useful tasks.
