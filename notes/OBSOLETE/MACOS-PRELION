INSTALLING NU
=============

These are the instructions for installing Nu on a Macintosh.  See the other files
in this directory for other operating systems.

If you're installed Nu previously using a package manager (e.g. Fink, MacPorts), 
start by using the package manager to uninstall the old version.

BUILD THE PREREQUISITES
-----------------------

1. Nu requires PCRE, the Perl-Compatible Regular Expression Library.
   Before building Nu, download and install pcre, enabling UTF-8.
   Look for it at http://www.pcre.org.  
   To build and install a universal binary with UTF-8 support, use the
   following commands:

   % env CXXFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc -arch x86_64" \
   	CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc -arch x86_64" \
   	LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc -arch x86_64" \
   	./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --enable-utf8

   % make

   % sudo make install

   When you install PCRE, it's best to put it in /usr/local (the default).
   If you put it anywhere else, you'll have to modify the Rakefile and Nukefile
   used to build Nu.

2. Nu requires libffi.  Because this library is not included in 
   OS X 10.4, a version has been provided in the libffi directory. 
   To build it, use the Ruby "rake" build tool and the included Rakefile.
   On OS X 10.5, you don't need to do this.

% cd libffi; rake; cd ..

BUILD NU
--------

3. Use make to build mininush, a minimal version of the Nu shell.

% make

4. Now use mininush to run nuke to complete the Nu build process.
   This builds Nu.framework and nush, the Nu shell.
 
% ./mininush tools/nuke

INSTALL AND TEST NU
-------------------

5. Use mininush again to install Nu, nush, and the Nu tools.

% ./mininush tools/nuke install

Since the copying step uses "sudo", you will be prompted for your password.

6. Test your installation.

% nuke test

From now on, you can use the installed nush to run nuke. To see for
yourself, rebuild everything from scratch:

% nuke clobber
% nuke
% nuke install

See the Nukefile for other useful tasks.
