GETTING HELP
============

Nu includes a simple built-in help system.

All objects derived from NSObject support the "help" message,
which returns an NSString presenting help information for
the object.

You can use this from Nu by either sending the help message
to an object or by using the help operator.  Here's an example
showing the use of the help operator:

% (help 99)
This is an instance of NSCFNumber.
% (help (NSApplication sharedApplication))
This is an instance of NSApplication.

This gets more interesting when we override the help method for
specific subclasses.  In nu/help.nu there are definitions of help
methods for most of the built-in Nu operators.  Here are some
examples:

% (help do)
This operator is used to create blocks.
For example, the following expression creates a 
block that returns the sum of its two arguments:
(do (x y)
        (+ x y))

% (help set)
This operator sets the value of a symbol to the result of an
expression evaluation.

% (help help)
This operator gets the help text for an object.

In that last case, the help operator is being called with itself
as an argument.  While this appears indistinguishable from 
sending the help message to the help object, the Nu precedence
policy is for lists beginning with operators to be treated as
operator calls and not message sends.  To send the help message
to the help object, use the send operator as follows:

% (send help help)
This operator gets the help text for an object.

In the future, more mechanisms for adding help information
will be built into Nu.  In the meantime, you can provide
help information for any of your objects by simply adding
the following method to your classes:

- (NSString *) help;
