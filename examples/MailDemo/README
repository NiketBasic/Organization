MailDemo in Nu

This directory contains a Nu version of Scott Stevenson's 
MailDemo tutorial.  You can find Scott's tutorial online at
	http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000080.php

This version does nearly everything in Nu.  The interface is
still built in IB, but instead of hooking up the controllers 
in IB, we expose the interface elements and then hook everything
up in Nu.  I think that makes the bindings a lot more clear,
because everything can then be described in just a few lines of
Nu that I can easily scan through and verify at once.  You 
can judge for yourself.
