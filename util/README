This directory contains code that creates a pool of predefined
method handlers for use with Nu on iOS. Feel free to alter the
mix of handlers as needed by your app.

These handlers are required because restrictions enforced by
mprotect() forbid us from generating executable method handlers
at runtime.

Anecdotally, this appears to not be necessary in some environments,
so please be sure to test your apps both in and out of the debugger
on all target device types (especially newer ones).
